# 🎯 TWO-PHASE BOOKING SYSTEM - TESTING GUIDE

## **📋 WHAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED:**

### **✅ Two-Phase Booking Flow:**
1. **Tour Operator** creates booking → Status: `pending`
2. **Client** receives confirmation link
3. **Client** visits page and pays → Status: `confirmed`
4. **Real-time updates** across all dashboards

---

## **🚀 TESTING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Tour Operator Creates Pending Booking**
1. **Login** as tour operator
2. **Add item to cart** (any excursion)
3. **Process cart** → Status becomes `pending`
4. **Check "Réservations en attente" tab** → Should show pending booking
5. **Check "Mes ventes" tab** → Should NOT show pending booking (only confirmed)

### **Step 2: Client Confirms and Pays**
1. **Copy confirmation link** from console logs
2. **Open new tab** with the link
3. **Verify** booking details are displayed
4. **Click "Confirmer et Payer"** → Wait 2 seconds
5. **Verify** success page appears

### **Step 3: Check Real-Time Updates**
1. **Refresh Tour Operator Dashboard**
2. **Check "Réservations en attente"** → Should be empty or reduced
3. **Check "Mes ventes"** → Should now show confirmed booking
4. **Check sales data** → Should include new confirmed revenue

## **🔍 WHAT TO VERIFY:**

### **✅ Tour Operator Dashboard:**
- **"Réservations en attente" tab** shows pending bookings
- **"Mes ventes" tab** only shows confirmed bookings
- **Sales data** only counts confirmed revenue
- **Commission** only calculated on confirmed bookings

### **✅ Client Experience:**
- **Confirmation page** loads with booking details
- **Payment simulation** works (2-second delay)
- **Status updates** from pending to confirmed
- **Success page** shows after payment

### **✅ Database:**
- **Booking status** changes: `pending` → `confirmed`
- **Real-time sync** across all dashboards

---

## **🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:**

### **Before Client Payment:**
- Status: `pending`
- Shows in "Réservations en attente"
- NOT counted in sales data
- No commission earned

### **After Client Payment:**
- Status: `confirmed`
- Moved to "Mes ventes"
- Counted in sales data
- Commission earned (15%)

---

## **🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **Issue: "Réservations en attente" tab not showing**
**Solution**: Check if `activeTab` state includes 'pending'

### **Issue: Client confirmation page not loading**
**Solution**: Verify React Router is properly configured

### **Issue: Booking status not updating**
**Solution**: Check RLS policies and database permissions
